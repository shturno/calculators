# Flask Calculators API

A Flask-based API for performing various mathematical calculations. This project provides endpoints for four different calculators, each implementing distinct algorithms.

## Features

- **Calculator 1**: Performs a complex mathematical operation on a single number.
- **Calculator 2**: Processes a list of numbers with statistical operations.
- **Calculator 3**: Calculates variance and verifies results against a multiplication factor.
- **Calculator 4**: Computes the median of a list of numbers.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

## Running the Application
To start the Flask server, run:
```bash
python run.py
```
The server will be available at http://localhost:3000
